fdups
--------
Parses fdupes utility log file, and filters out records corresponding to given limit.
If limit is not set, just converts the sizes to human-readable form.

usage example
--------
When invoking fdupes, remember that -S key is a must, cause other way no sizes will
be printed, and all this is useless

$ fdupes -rS somepath > dups.log # 
$ fdups.py -i dups.log -l 100000

Here we told fdups.py to read from dups.log, and filter out records less than 100000
bytes. By default, output goes to dups.log.out, if it's not set explicitly.
Detailed command line arguments information is in the help message, just run:
$ fdups.py -h
